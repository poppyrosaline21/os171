By executing the above command you will enter vi. By default the first time you enter vi you will be in command mode. This mode is used to access commands in vi, not to write, so that when you try to type (try typing letter g), it's not printed in the text area because vi translate your typing into commands that can be accessed by typing letter g. This command mode can be accessed anytime by pushing Esc (Escape) button on the left side of your keyboard. Now go ahead and press Esc.
